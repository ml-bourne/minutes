## Minutes

* First goal is to get a workflow that outputs the correct submission format

* Then we can iterate through different classifiers/parameters/features

* We will look at using fourier transform on the data

* Twitter: we have a Twitter account, twitting ".@ml_bourne" it when we see interesting links would be a good way to keep a tab of subjects to talk about in our meetings. From that account, we can also re-tweet links every now and then.
