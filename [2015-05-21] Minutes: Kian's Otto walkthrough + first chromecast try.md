## Minutes

### Chromecast + internet troubleshooting
* Internet
  * can't trust vlsci network, eduroam or even the free Telstra wifi: spotty
  * Plugged router: works great but wall ethernet did not provide internet access
  * next solutions: check ethernet wall access, or try other room
* Chromecast + TV
  * Worked great!! Anyone can "claim" the chromecast and display their page
  * Can connect directly to "VLSCI_Chromecast" or connect to same network as the Chromecast (but then not connected to the internet!)
  * That will work great!

### Topics on the day
* Kian's walkthrough on the Otto dataset:
  * Loading data + glance at what it is
  * basic error checking
  * 2 classifiers
  * cross validation
  * test
  * Ask Kian a question on GitHub if you have one!
* Alistair talked about Docker (potential topic soon!)
* Grischa talked about DIGITS from NVIDIA
 * https://developer.nvidia.com/devbox
  
### Future thoughts
* Change room, at VLSCI or elsewhere
* Create a list of "things to learn" on GitHub: anyone can pick a topic, learn about it a bit more, then present it to everyone the next week
* Could change to evenings: will poll via an issue to ask which evening would suit
* Let's not emulate what already exists (Data Science Melbourne Meetup): try to be hands-on and not presentation style. That already exists and is done well already.
