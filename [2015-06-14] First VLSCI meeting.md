## Talking points about organisation
* Venue
  * Great VLSCI venue, need magnetic card to go anywhere though: could we get visitor cards?
  * Would be great to have a screen + Chromecast to share screen in turn
* Communication
  * Talked Slack, Trello, Mailinglist
  * Decided for now: use GitHub
    * Use issues for discussion
    * Share "exercise of the week" in advance on there
* Take turns in being the "teacher" on an "exercise of the week"
  * After each meeting: self-designated "teacher" for the next week

## Talking point data science

  * Use pandasDataFrame.values to extract numpy array (WARNING: extract floats, different for strings contained in dataFrames)
